# Keithley Instrument Communicator

The Keithley Instrument Communicator (KIC) is a command-line application that enables simple communication to an instrument.

## Getting started
<details>
<summary>Developer Setup</summary>

## Developer Setup

If you are developing on this project, it is in your best interest to add the provided pre-commit hook to your local `.git/hooks` folder.

```bash
cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will make commits take longer, but will ensure CI/CD doesn't fail due to linting, formatting, or build errors that should have been caught before your commit.

If there is a specific reason you want to finish the commit without running the pre-commit checks (e.g. You want to commit a work in progress that doesn't build, or there is a specific reason to commit to `dev`), you can run the following in a terminal:

```bash
git commit -m "<COMMIT_MESSAGE>" --no-verify
```
